# Conjugation-Bible-2.0
        About the Program
This program is designed to help language learners practice verb conjugations in 
Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and/or French.   Although it is still under 
construction, the goal is that eventually, every tense in each of the four 
languages will be available, and every model verb (stem changers, irregulars, 
etc.) will be represented.  This is a project that I started on Quizlet back before I knew how to code and when Quizlet was free (I know, that's so low tech. It's fine though because I'm evolving).

        Tips & Encouragement
     
In my experience, learning new romance languages is easier when learned in 
I was afraid that learning French in close proximity to Spanish would cause me to forget my Spanish, but 
with time, I realized that it actually helps to differentiate between foreign languages 
so that their differences are more distinct and harder to confuse.   I realized that 
initially confusing languages is a natural part of the learning process and unavoidable. 
Don't get discouraged if you notice yourself mixing them up.   I think of it like amoebas; 
over time, they will separate out.  
    
I hope this helps.  Multilingual resources are limited and often not thorough.  Contact me if you have any suggestions or questions.  :)
